# Python Basics: Introduction.

This unit provides a basic introduction to Python. By the end of the series, you should be able to:

1. Run Python from the Anaconda Navigator in a Jupyter Notebook.
2. Write basic commands using Python syntax.
3. Grasp the major Python [object](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-intensive/blob/master/Glossary.md#object) [types](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-intensive/blob/master/Glossary.md#type), including [integers](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-intensive/blob/master/Glossary.md#integer), [floats](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-intensive/blob/master/Glossary.md#floating-point-number), [strings](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-intensive/blob/master/Glossary.md#string), lists, sets, and dictionaries
4. Operate and manipulate those objects.
5. Control the flow of your programs using [conditionals](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-intensive/blob/master/Glossary.md#conditional-statement).

## What it means to "know how to program"

Most programmers can program in more than one language. That's because they know *how to program* generally, as opposed to "knowing" Python, R, Ruby, or any other language.

In other words, programming is an extendible skill. Basic programming concepts -- conditionals, for loops, functions -- can be found in almost any programming language.

That being said, programming languages differ from one another in the following ways:

1. **Syntax**: The precise rules of how to structure code in a language. For example, whether to add a semicolon at the end of each line.
2. **Usage**: Different programming languages are designed with different aims in mind. For example, JavaScript is generally for building websites, R is primarily a statistical programming language, Python is a general purpose programming lanaguage, etc.
3. **Level**: How close you are to the hardware. Programming languages ultimately end up as assembly code or machin 'C' is often considered one of the lowest level programming language in that 
4. **Object-oriented:** "objects" are data + functions. Some programming languages are object-oriented (e.g. Python) and some aren't (e.g. C).
5. **Many more**: Here's a [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_programming_languages_by_type) of all the types of programming languages out there.

So what should your first programming language be? That is, what programming language should you use to learn *how to program*? At the end of the day, the answer depends on what you want to get out of programming. Many people recommend Python because its fun, easy, and multi-purpose. Here's an [article](http://lifehacker.com/which-programming-language-should-i-learn-first-1477153665) that can offer more advice.

Regardless of what you choose, you will probably grow 'comfortable' in one language while learning the basic concepts and skills that allow you to 'hack' your way into other languages.  

Thus "knowing how to program" means learning how to *think* like a programmer, not necessarily knowing all the language-specific commands off the top of your head. **Don't learn specific programming languages; learn how to program.**

## What programming is like

![xkcd](http://sslimgs.xkcd.com/comics/wisdom_of_the_ancients.png)

Here's the sad reality: When you're programming, 80% or more of your time will be spent debugging, looking stuff up (like program-specific syntax, [documentation](https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/python-intensive/blob/master/Glossary.md#documentation) for packages, useful functions, etc.), or testing. This does not just apply to beginner or intermediate programmers, although you will grow more "fluent" over time.

If you're a good programmer, you're a good detective!

## Debugging

1. Read the errors!
2. Read the documentation
2. Make it smaller
3. Figure out what changed
4. Check your syntax
5. Print statements are your friend

## Googling Errors

Here are some tips on how to use Google to resolve errors you run might into:

* Enter in Google the name of the computer language and the text in error message.
* Be sure to remove user- and data-specific information first!
* See if you can find examples that do and donâ€™t produce the error

## Stack Overflow Example

Often when you Google something, the most relevant and helpful result will be someone asking a similar question on StackOverflow. Just to give you an example of what this looks like, [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1228299/change-one-character-in-a-string) is one of the top results if you Google "python change one character in a string". When we talk about strings and lists, you'll see why this might be a question you have!

StackOverflow is a great resource by which people can ask and answer questions. In the above case, there's a lot of different answers to the question -- some more detailed than others -- and you can go with the approach that works best for you.

Don't reinvent the wheel -- learning how to find the answer to the issues you run into is a critical part of becoming a capable programmer!
