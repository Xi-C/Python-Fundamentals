    "# How do I run Python on my machine?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few options for running Python: \n",
    "\n",
    "1). **Jupyter Notebook:** This is what all of our workshop materials are in. Files have the extention .ipynb and are organized into executable cells. This is used for tasks like data processing and analysis, and is likely the most common format you'll encounter in Python programming. Jupyter notebooks comes with Anaconda Navigator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2). **Google Colab:** Similar in layout to a Jupyter notebooks. The key difference is that Colab is hosted on Google servers rather than being run locally on your machine. This has more support for parallel processing, and doesn't require a Python distribution on your machine. Uses .ipynb format.\n",
    "\n",
    "3). **Spyder (or other [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_integrated_development_environments#Python)):** An IDE (integrated development environment) is a software application that gives a bunch of tools for debugging and development. Files are in the format .py. These environments are usually used for software development or large programs. Spyder comes installed with the Anaconda distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "4). **Terminal/ Command line:** It is also possible to run .py scripts directly in your terminal or command line (and even write the script in a text editor). This is not used for active development because it lacks the edtor and tools of the above methods.\n",

    "\n",
    "Some machines have Python pre-installed. However, we encourage students to download the Anaconda distribution of Python, which includes all of the software and packages that we will use throughout this workshop. \n",

    "1. Open the Anaconda Navigator program on your computer.\n",
    "2. Open Jupyter Notebook from there.\n",
    "3. Navigate to the `python-fundamentals-master` folder. Depending on what your home directory is, this most likely mean clicking the \"Desktop\" folder, at which point `python-fundamentals-master` should be visible.\n",
